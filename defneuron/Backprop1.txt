;;;   (*NINPUTS* + 1), (*NHIDDEN* + 1), and *NOUTPUTS*.
;;; This is because the input layer and the hidden layer each have
;;; a "dummy unit" whose activation is always 1, which feeds the units
;;; of the next layer in lieu of their having a "threshold" or "bias".
;;; The weights for the threshold links are learned just like all
;;; the others.
