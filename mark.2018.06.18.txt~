Hello Mark---

Here the time is 2344 PM, and I decided to show to you what I have
done with the ANN work.

I attach the backpropagation program as a set of source files.  Load
them by giving

(load "lbp.shen")

to the Shen.  I decided not to use types.

The:

1 backpropagation; and,

2 the Hopfield ANN (when used to solve NP problems); and,

3 the SVM, the Support Vector Machine,

are to my knowledge the real work horses of the ANN world.

Then there are the Kohonen SOM, and some other ones.
