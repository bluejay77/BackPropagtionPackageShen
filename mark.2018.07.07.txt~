Hi,

I wanted to show the phase of the backpropagation software.

The set of files will load.

The data structures are OK, after a very significant amount of work.

The neurons are Shen symbols.  Their fields are properties of symbols,
implemented with the properties of the underlying LISP.  If the neuron
symbol is e g *S*, you can do

(getp *S* pdoc) \\ Documentation of neuron

(getp *S* pouts) \\ Synapses output vector of the neuron *S*

(getp *S* pnn) \\ Numeric ID

etc.

The user can show all the ANN training samples with

(show-samples)

I wrote a function (dsp) to show the samples and the corresponding
output ANN layer.
