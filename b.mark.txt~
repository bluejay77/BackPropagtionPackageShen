Hi,

I have been working with the backpropagation program.  Actually, I
have three ANN applications in mind: the backpropagation; the
Hopfield; and the Support Vector Machines.  These ones are the truly
useful ones.

I attach the user application data file concerning how I have been
planning for the backpropagation program to be used.

We could give the program to the user as the above mentioned binary
file, and have the user simply to Shen load the bapp.shen file as:
(load "bapp.shen") into the binary LISP image file created above.
