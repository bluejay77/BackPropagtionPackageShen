Hello Mark,

The first working commercial ANN program is approaching completion,
after a significant amount of work.

The program will run, but it does not converge well.  There is a bug
in the mathematics, which error I will have to detect and correct.

Do

(load "lbp.shen")

and then see the training material:

(show-samples)

and see how the non-trained net behaves:

(dsp)

Then do

(time (train-n 1000))

with this 64bit laptop 1000 ANN training rounds will take some 4
seconds.

After this do again

(dsp)

You can see that the ANN backpropagation iteration did not converge:
An error in the formulas will still have to be corrected by me.

There is a design decision here.  This program is the (Winston, 1992)
algorithm.  Can we sell it (corrected) as such?  Will I have to
program the Anastasiadis resilient backpropagation?  I will have to
consider that one.
